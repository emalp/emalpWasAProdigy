# emalpWasAProdigy

This was one of the first softwares created by me.(I was 9, trust me I was a prodigy)   
All of the programs were made using visual basic .net which was one of the first languages I learnt.  
No github back in the days so I found these sitting somewhere in one of my online file host.   

A brief of all the softwares are:
-----------------------------------

# Easy Media Player:
 - This is a fully functional media player made using the simple media functionality that visual basic .net provides.
 - Just click on Help -> About and you'll know the inner nerd in me.
 
# Messenger:
 - This is a simple inner network LAN Messenger, also done in Visual Basic .net
 - Just enter the IP address in the LAN, also make the other person do the same and viola, talk to each other.
 - I know it's lame but appreciate the 9 year old!
 
# Narrator:
 - Just a simple voice narrator, i.e It narrates whatever you type in it.
 - Made using visual basic script (vbs)
 
# Super Hacker!!!:
 - First of all, its not a super hacker!!!
 - Just keeps on creating random 5 digit alphanumeric values which you can create a wordlist from.
 - Usage is pretty simple, just run the program and then open notepad or any text editor you like. Then click on 'start' and click on
  the empty space in your text editor. See the magic!
  
 Yeah, I was a prodigy nerd.
